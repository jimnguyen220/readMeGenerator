# README-generator
command-line application that dynamically generates a professional README.md file from a user's input

## Objectives

The goal of  this project is to use the command line in Node.js to create a README file.  The information on this README file will be inputted by the user, then dynamically created to a generateREADME.md file.

The generated README must meet the following criteria:

* User inputs their information when prompted on a command-line application
 
* After answering questions, the information creates a README file that generates Title of project and includes sections entitled Description, Table of Contents, Installation, Usage, License, Contributing, Tests and Questions.

* A badge is displayed near the top of the README indicating which license the user selects and includes an explanation of the license in that section.

* Questions section will include what the user entered in for the Github username, email address and instructions on how t o reach them with additional questions.

* Table of contents section will allow for user to click the links and is  taken to the corresponding section of README


This project will not include a link to a live website.  A video walkthrough of the application is below
